# Coffee Roaster Notes

Take notes from coffee roaster experiences.

## Recipe Syntax

'6.5L0.7 > 1.0M.9' reads like this: _start with 6.5 minutes at low temperature and 70% fan speed, when remaing 1.0 minute change temperature to medium and fan speed to 90%_.

## Motivation

After taking several notes into some pieces of paper of my experiemnts roast green coffee beans, it started look quite confusing to remember how one roast looked like without a picture.

## Quasar and VueJs

This is also a Quasar and VueJS experiment.
